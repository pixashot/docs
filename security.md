# Security

Ensuring the security of your Pixashot deployment is crucial. This section covers key aspects of security, including API key management, HTTPS configuration, data privacy, and best practices.

## API Key Management

Proper management of API keys is essential to maintain the security of your Pixashot instance.

- **Generation**: Use strong, unique API keys for each client or application.
- **Storage**: Store API keys securely, never in plaintext or in version control systems.
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the impact of potential breaches.
- **Revocation**: Implement a process to quickly revoke compromised API keys.

Best Practices:
- Use environment variables or secure key management systems to store API keys.
- Implement API key expiration and automatic rotation policies.
- Log all API key usage for audit purposes.

## HTTPS Configuration

Securing your Pixashot instance with HTTPS is crucial to protect data in transit.

- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Use valid SSL/TLS certificates from trusted Certificate Authorities.
- **Protocol Version**: Support only TLS 1.2 and above, disabling older, insecure protocols.
- **Cipher Suites**: Configure strong cipher suites and disable weak ones.

Implementation:
1. Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., Let's Encrypt, commercial CA).
2. Configure your web server or reverse proxy with the certificate.
3. Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) for added security.

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-pixashot-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/certificate.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

    # Other server configurations...
}
```

## Data Privacy

Protecting user data and ensuring privacy is a key responsibility when using Pixashot.

- **Data Minimization**: Only capture and store necessary information.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to captured data.
- **Data Retention**: Establish and enforce data retention policies.

Considerations:
- Be aware of and comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Implement mechanisms for users to request data deletion or access their captured data.
- Regularly audit data access and usage.

## Best Practices

Follow these security best practices to maintain a robust and secure Pixashot deployment:

1. **Regular Updates**:
    - Keep Pixashot, its dependencies, and the host system up to date with the latest security patches.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
    - Run Pixashot with minimal necessary permissions.
    - Use separate accounts for administration and regular operations.

3. **Network Security**:
    - Use firewalls to restrict access to only necessary ports and IP ranges.
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Set up comprehensive logging for all Pixashot activities.
    - Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities.

5. **Secure Configurations**:
    - Disable unnecessary features and services.
    - Use secure defaults and avoid exposing debug information in production.

6. **Input Validation**:
    - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

7. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
    - Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.

8. **Regular Security Audits**:
    - Conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing.

9. **Incident Response Plan**:
    - Develop and maintain an incident response plan for security breaches.

10. **Third-Party Dependencies**:
    - Regularly audit and update third-party libraries and dependencies.
    - Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities.

Example CSP Header:
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self';
```

By implementing these security measures and following best practices, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your Pixashot deployment. Remember that security is an ongoing process, requiring regular attention and updates to stay ahead of emerging threats.
