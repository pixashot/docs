# Client Library Examples

While Pixashot doesn't currently provide official client libraries, here are examples of how to integrate with the API using standard HTTP libraries in various languages. Each example includes error handling, retry logic, and common usage patterns.

## Basic Authentication

All examples use token-based authentication:

```bash
# Include in request headers
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```

## Available Examples

### Node.js
- Using `fetch` or `axios`
- Complete error handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- TypeScript support

### Python
- Using `requests` library
- Async support with `aiohttp`
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints and validation

### PHP
- Using Guzzle HTTP client
- PSR-7 compliant requests
- Proper error handling
- Composer package structure

## Common Features

All examples demonstrate:
- Screenshot capture
- PDF generation
- Error handling
- Retry logic
- Rate limit handling
- Type-safe options
- Response processing

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred language example
2. Copy the example code
3. Replace `your_token_here` with the token you created
4. Customize the options as needed

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling
- Use retry logic with backoff
- Handle rate limits appropriately
- Set reasonable timeouts
- Validate input parameters
- Clean up temporary files
